# Phase1_Project
This is my repository for the Phase 1 Project for the Flatiron School.

I wanted to solve the problem of getting Microsoft into the movie business.
That's a big question, there's a lot to look at regarding movies and what makes them successful or not. To simplify, I looked at money, also assuming Microsoft would be interested in making money.
The prject provided a number of files to read, which I did. I then decided I wanted other data, so I did some web scraping from Wikipedia and TheNumbers.
I made a number of very handsome graphs illustrating this data. 
I came to the conclusion early on that sequels were the simplest answer to how to make money making movies. The majority of the movies were sequels, and not just the first sequel, many were the 3rd or higher in the series.
I went a little further into sequels, looking at the highest grossing sequels, and again most were the 3rd or higher.
Then I went into video game movies, from Box Office Mojo, the 10 highest grossing video game movies. I was pleased to see that 2 of the Resident Evil movies were there.
This led me to look deeper into that series, and graphed how each movie made more money than the previous (with 1 exception).
I then compiled some data from Microsoft's video game franchises, and saw how much they were worth.
At this point I was prepared to turn in the project. I made my powerpoint presentation, this repository, etc. And made my first presentation

After the initial presentation, I was advised to get some more data, specifically genre data as well as a "large" dataset. So the revisions were my attempt to comply.
I was tasked with getting an aspect of the movies, and looking at that. So I picked genre, found some data on how much each genre has made, as well as the number of movies produced, graphed that.
I was also tasked with parsing data from a large dataset, I found the file mentioned below. I merged it with one of the datasets provided, and got it down to a manageable number.

There is a dataset I could not fit on this repository, title.akas.tsv.gz, it's located here:
